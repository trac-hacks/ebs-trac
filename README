A plug-in that enables evidence-based scheduling in Trac.

		Done	Logging time
		Done	Listing tickets
		Test	Clock in / clock out
		Test	Schedule graphs.

	NOTE:

	I have not audited the code to confirm that malicious input won't
	break stuff.  We are using it in a trusted environment.

	(The logic does check that the user that has authenticated (via
	HTTPS), is the owner of the ticket before allowing data to be
	inserted.)

DEPENDENCIES

	The plugin was developed against Trac 0.10.4, which is ancient,
	but hopefully it will work any subsequent version.  It doesn't
	do anything very tricky, just uses the RequestHandler interface
	and custom ticket fields.

	To use the command-line client utilities, you need to have
	curl and python installed.


INSTALLING THE CLIENT

	Do this to book time and estimates to the Trac server.

	First, look at the Makefile variables:

		MANDIR=/usr/local/share/man
		BINDIR=/usr/local/bin

	and edit if necessary.

	Next, install the client utilities and their man pages:

		$ sudo make install-client

	To test the man pages were installed correctly, type:

		$ man ebsconf


INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

	Do this on the server that hosts Trac.

		$ make
		$ sudo make install

	Edit your trac conf (e.g., /usr/local/trac/conf/trac.ini)
	to enable the ebstrac component.

		...
		[components]
		ebstrac.* = enabled
		...
		[ticket-custom]
		estimatedhours = text
		estimatedhours.label = Estimated Hours
		estimatedhours.order = 1
		estimatedhours.value = 0
		actualhours = text
		actualhours.label = Actual Hours
		actualhours.order = 2
		actualhours.value = 0
		...

	If you are running trac as a FastCGI daemon, you'll
	have to kill then restart the daemon.

		"Tracker is a free, award winning, agile project
		management tool that enables real time collaboration
		around a shared, prioritzed backlog."

		They use velocity, but it's based on task points,
		not hours.  Also, some of their task types ("Bugs",
		"Chores", etc) don't get points.  Cool UI though.

		For me, using hours is key as it connects to the
		timesheet.  If you want process control around the
		development process, you have to track labor.
		People want to get paid for their time, so providing a
		connection to timesheets seems like the simplest way.
